## Features

- üöÄ Real-time log streaming and visualization
- üîç Advanced log filtering and search capabilities
- üìä Interactive dashboard with metrics
- üîê Configurable logging levels and formats
- üê≥ Docker-ready deployment
- ‚ö° Built with Next.js and Go for high performance

## Architecture

The application is composed of a Go backend and a Next.js frontend. The backend consists of two services:

-   **`log-generator`**: A service that generates logs at a configurable rate and format.
-   **`log-collector`**: A service that collects logs from the `log-generator` and exposes them to the frontend.
-   **`parser`**: A service that parses logs from various formats (e.g., apache, nginx, json) and enriches them with additional information.
-   **`storage`**: A service that stores and manages log data, including indexing and rotation.
-   **`query`**: A service that provides a command-line interface for searching and filtering logs.
-   **`centrifugo`**: A real-time messaging server that streams logs to the frontend.

The frontend is a Next.js application that provides a web interface for viewing and filtering logs.

## Quick Start

The recommended way to run the project is with Docker.

```bash
docker compose up -d
```
